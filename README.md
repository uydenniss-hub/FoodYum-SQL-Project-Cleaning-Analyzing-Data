SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis (FoodYum Dataset)
📌 What This Project Shows

This notebook highlights my ability to use SQL (PostgreSQL) for:

Cleaning messy data (handling nulls, standardizing text, parsing weights)

Imputing missing values with a robust median strategy

Aggregating metrics (price ranges by product type)

Filtering insights (finding top-selling product groups)

⚙️ Key Skills Demonstrated

COALESCE, NULLIF → handling missing values

REGEXP_REPLACE → cleaning text fields

PERCENTILE_DISC → calculating medians

CTEs & clean SQL structure → maintainability & readability

🎯 Why It Matters

Real-world data is messy. This project shows how I can:

Turn inconsistent raw data into clean, reliable fields

Apply defensible imputation strategies (e.g., median over mean)

Write production-ready SQL that’s both correct and easy to follow
