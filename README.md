# 🥗 FoodYum SQL Project: Cleaning & Analyzing Messy Data

**Description**  
A concise SQL project showcasing my ability to transform messy, incomplete product data into clean, reliable insights.  
Using PostgreSQL, I demonstrate data cleaning, median-based imputation, text standardization, and aggregation techniques  
that are directly applicable to real-world business analysis.

## 📌 What This Project Shows
This notebook highlights my ability to use **SQL (PostgreSQL)** for:

- **Cleaning messy data** (handling nulls, standardizing text, parsing weights)  
- **Imputing missing values** with a robust median strategy  
- **Aggregating metrics** (price ranges by product type)  
- **Filtering insights** (finding top-selling product groups)

## ⚙️ Key Skills Demonstrated
- `COALESCE`, `NULLIF` → handling missing values  
- `REGEXP_REPLACE` → cleaning text fields  
- `PERCENTILE_DISC` → calculating medians  
- `CTEs` & clean SQL structure → maintainability & readability

## 🎯 Why It Matters
Real-world data is messy. This project shows how I can:

- Turn **inconsistent raw data** into clean, reliable fields  
- Apply **defensible imputation strategies** (e.g., median over mean)  
- Write **production-ready SQL** that’s both correct and easy to follow
